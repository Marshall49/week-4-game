We are gonna psuedocode here.

The point of the game is:
we are clicking on 4 different teams, each with a new random numerical value, and we want to make the values that we are adding together exactly equal to another random number. 

1. The number that we wanna reach.
	-gonna be random every time the game starts
	
2. A display of the wins and losses.

3. The teams and their random values.
	- 4 teams
	-each has a random value
	-every time you click one, that value gets added to the 'score'
	-every time the game starts, the teams get a new random value

4. The number that gets updated every time we click a teams.
